    "O Son of Being! Thy heart is My home; sanctify it for My descent. Thy spirit is My place of revelation; cleanse it for My manifestation.",

    "O Son of Being! How couldst thou forget thine own faults and busy thyself with the faults of others? Whoso doeth this is accursed of Me.",
    "O Son of Being! Seek a martyr's death in My path, content with My pleasure and thankful for that which hath befallen thee, for thus wilt thou abide in prosperity and comfort in the realm of eternity.",
